# Fixed Build Commands - Desktop Monitoring Agent

## The Problem You Encountered
The build was failing because of missing platform-specific dependencies (Cocoa, Foundation, etc.) that aren't available on all systems.

## Fixed Solution

### Quick Fix Commands:

#### For macOS (.dmg):
```bash
python3 fix_and_build.py
```

#### For Windows (.exe):
```cmd
python fix_and_build.py
```

#### For Linux (.deb):
```bash
python3 fix_and_build.py
```

## What the Fix Does:
- Only installs dependencies that work on all platforms
- Creates a custom PyInstaller spec file that handles missing imports gracefully
- Builds packages without requiring platform-specific frameworks
- Creates working installers for each platform

## Manual Build (if needed):
```bash
# Install core dependencies only
pip install pyinstaller pillow requests schedule mss psutil

# Build with the fixed script
python3 fix_and_build.py
```

## Output Files:
- **macOS**: `DesktopMonitoringAgent-macOS.dmg` or folder
- **Windows**: `DesktopMonitoringAgent-Windows/` folder with installer
- **Linux**: `DesktopMonitoringAgent-Linux/` folder with installer

## Installation:
- **macOS**: `chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`
- **Windows**: Right-click `install.bat` â†’ Run as administrator
- **Linux**: `chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`

The fixed build script avoids all the dependency issues you encountered and creates working packages.
