# FIXED Windows Build Instructions

## Error You Encountered:
Build was failing due to missing platform-specific dependencies.

## FIXED Solution:
```cmd
# Extract this package
# Extract DesktopMonitoringAgent-Windows-FIXED.zip

# Use the FIXED build script
python fix_and_build.py
```

## Alternative Quick Build:
```cmd
# Install only essential dependencies
pip install pyinstaller pillow requests schedule mss psutil

# Run the fixed build
python fix_and_build.py
```

## What This Fixes:
- Only uses dependencies that work on all systems
- Creates custom PyInstaller spec file
- Handles missing imports gracefully
- Builds working .exe file

## Output:
- DesktopMonitoringAgent-Windows/ folder
- Contains .exe file and installer scripts

## Installation on Target Machines:
1. Extract the built package
2. Right-click install.bat
3. Select "Run as administrator"
4. Follow prompts
5. Agent starts automatically with Windows

No more dependency errors with this fixed version.
